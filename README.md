**### Objective:**
To get the data from the LM35 sensor over Bolt cloud and view the temperature throughout by writing a JavaScript program and also notify the user through SMS using Twilio  if the temperature rises too cross the threshold by writing a Python code.

Hardware required:

- The Bolt Wifi module
- 3 female to male wire
- Temperature Sensor: LM35 sensor

Software Required:

- Twilio
- Bolt cloud
- VM Ware
- Ubuntu

Hardware Connections:

- Keep the sensor in a manner such that you can read LM35 written on it. Left - VCC,  Middle - Output and Right - Gnd.
- VCC pin of the LM35 is connected to 5v of the Bolt Wifi module using  female to male wire.
- Output pin of the LM35 is connected to A0 (Analog input pin) of the Bolt Wifi module using female to male wire.
- Gnd pin of the LM35 is connected to the Gnd using female to male wire

Programming:

- 1. Login in [cloud.boltiot.com](https://cloud.boltiot.com/) and make a new product. Link the device to your Bolt cloud.
- 2. In hardware section give the variable name = temp to A0 pin.
- 3. Configure the device by the js code for Polynomial Regression.

4. Login into your Twilio account and get these credentials.

SID = 'You can find SID in your Twilio Dashboard' 

AUTH_TOKEN = 'You can find  on your Twilio Dashboard' 

FROM_NUMBER = 'This is the number generated by Twilio. You can find this on your Twilio Dashboard'

6.Open VM ware and make file config.py  by using command : sudo nano config.py. Type the following code and save.
```
SID = 'You can find SID in your Twilio Dashboard' 
AUTH_TOKEN = 'You can find  on your Twilio Dashboard' 
FROM_NUMBER = 'This is the no. generated by Twilio. You can find this on your Twilio Dashboard'
TO_NUMBER = 'This is your number. Make sure you are adding +91 in beginning'
API_KEY = 'This is your Bolt Cloud accout API key'
DEVICE_ID = 'This is the ID of your Bolt device' 
```

7. Make file temp_sms.py by using command : sudo nano temp_sms.py Type the following code and save.

Try varying the temperature by using ice sometimes and sometimes small fire lit by matchstick (DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH THE DEVICE)for instant results.
OUTPUTS:
O/P in VM WARE.

You can  click on 'deploy configuration' button and then the 'view this device' icon to view the graph. Below is the screenshot of the final output.

Code for polynomial regression:
```
setChartLibrary('google-chart');
setChartTitle('Plant Health Predictor');
setChartType('predictionGraph');
setAxisName('time_stamp','temp');
mul(0.0977);
plotChart('time_stamp','temp');
```

When you will click on the predict button. Two graphs other than the data graph are shown. These graphs are the prediction history and the predicted data. The screenshot is attached above.
